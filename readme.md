# Eses Image Adjustments

![Eses Image Adjustments Node Screenshot](docs/image_adjustments.png)

## Description

The 'Eses Image Adjustments' is a ComfyUI custom node designed for simple and easy to use image post-processing. It provides a sequential pipeline for fine-tuning various image aspects, utilizing PyTorch for GPU acceleration and efficient tensor operations. If you want a node with minimal dependecies, and don't want to download ten nodes to get images adjustment features, then give this one a try! 

üí° This is not a replacement for separate image adjustment nodes, as you can't reorder operations here (these are done pretty much in order you see the UI elements). 

üí° This node is meant for quick and easy to use color adjustments. 

üéûÔ∏è Film grain is relatively fast (mainly the reason I put this together), 4000x6000 pixels image takes ~2-3 seconds to process.


## Features

* **Global Tonal Adjustments**:
    * **Contrast**: Modifies the distinction between light and dark areas.
    * **Gamma**: Manages mid-tone brightness.
    * **Saturation**: Controls the vibrancy of image colors.

* **Color Adjustments**:
    * **Hue Rotation**: Rotates the entire color spectrum of the image.
    * **RGB Channel Offsets**: Enables precise color grading through individual adjustments to Red, Green, and Blue channels.

* **Creative Effects**:
    * **Color Gel**: Applies a customizable colored tint to the image. The gel color can be specified using hex codes (e.g., `#RRGGBB`) or RGB comma-separated values (e.g., `R,G,B`). Adjustable strength controls the intensity of the tint.

* **Sharpness**:
    * **Sharpness**: Adjusts the overall sharpness of the image.

* **Black & White Conversion**:
    * **Grayscale**: Converts the image to black and white with a single toggle.

* **Film Grain**:
    * **Grain Strength**: Controls the intensity of the added film grain.
    * **Grain Contrast**: Adjusts the contrast of the grain for either subtle or pronounced effects.
    * **Color Grain Mix**: Blends between monochromatic and colored grain.


## Requirements

* Python >= 3.9  (tested only with Python 3.12)
* PyTorch (you should have this if you have ComfyUI installed.)


## Installation

1.  **Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:**
    ```
    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```

2.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/quasiblob/ComfyUI-EsesImageAdjustments.git
    ```

3.  **Restart ComfyUI:**
    * After restarting, the "Eses Image Adjustments 2" node will be available in the "Eses Nodes/Image Adjustments" category.

## Usage

* Connect your image tensor to the `image` input of the `Eses Image Adjustments 2` node within ComfyUI.
* Adjust the desired parameters using the provided sliders and input fields.
* The node outputs the `adjusted_image` tensor, maintaining compatibility with other ComfyUI nodes.
* An optional `mask` input is also available, which will be passed through to the `original_mask` output.
